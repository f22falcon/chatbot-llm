artificial intelligence ai is the capability of computational systems to perform tasks typically associated with human intelligence such as learning reasoning problemsolving perception and decisionmaking it is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals1

highprofile applications of ai include advanced web search engines eg google search recommendation systems used by youtube amazon and netflix virtual assistants eg google assistant siri and alexa autonomous vehicles eg waymo generative and creative tools eg language models and ai art and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games eg chess and go however many ai applications are not perceived as ai a lot of cutting edge ai has filtered into general applications often without being called ai because once something becomes useful enough and common enough its not labeled ai anymore23

various subfields of ai research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools the traditional goals of ai research include learning reasoning knowledge representation planning natural language processing perception and support for roboticsa to reach these goals ai researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques including search and mathematical optimization formal logic artificial neural networks and methods based on statistics operations research and economicsb ai also draws upon psychology linguistics philosophy neuroscience and other fields4 some companies such as openai google deepmind and meta5 aim to create artificial general intelligence agiai that can complete virtually any cognitive task at least as well as a human

artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 19566 and the field went through multiple cycles of optimism throughout its history78 followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding known as ai winters910 funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when graphics processing units started being used to accelerate neural networks and deep learning outperformed previous ai techniques11 this growth accelerated further after 2017 with the transformer architecture12 in the 2020s an ongoing period of rapid progress in advanced generative ai became known as the ai boom generative ais ability to create and modify content has led to several unintended consequences and harms ethical concerns have been raised about ais longterm effects and potential existential risks prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology 
he general problem of simulating or creating intelligence has been broken into subproblems these consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display the traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of ai researcha
reasoning and problemsolving

early researchers developed algorithms that imitated stepbystep reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or 
make logical deductions13 by the late 1980s and 1990s methods were developed for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information employing concepts from probability and economics14

many of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a combinatorial explosion they become exponentially slower as the problems grow15 even humans rarely use the stepbystep deduction that early ai research could model they solve most of their problems using fast intuitive judgments16 accurate and efficient reasoning is an unsolved problem
